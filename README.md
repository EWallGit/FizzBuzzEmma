# FizzBuzz

JavaScript starter pack for the 'FizzBuzz' assignment

## Task
- Open the file called `fizzbuzz.js`
- Write a program that loops through numbers 1 to 100, and outputs 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the number
- For each number in the loop:
    - If the number is a multiple of 3, output 'Fizz'
    - If the number is a multiple of 5, output 'Buzz'
    - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, output 'FizzBuzz'
    - If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, output the number
- Output using the `output()` function. e.g. `output('Fizz')`

### Example

```bash
